## 🛠️ Offensive Security Projects
### 🔹 [Dll Shellcode Loader](https://github.com/JimKw1kX/Dll-Shellcode-Loader)
- A custom DLL shellcode loader that evades EDR detection using syscalls and direct memory injection.

### 🔹 [Havoc-C2-Modification-YARA-Free](https://github.com/JimKw1kX/Havoc-C2-Modification-YARA-Free)

- Modified [Havoc](https://github.com/HavocFramework/Havoc) to successfully achieved 0% YARA detection, enabling safer in-memory execution via a loader and evading detection by common YARA scans used by Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems.

### 🔹 [AES Lsass dump tool](https://github.com/JimKw1kX/AES-Lsass-dump-via-duplicated-handle)

- A Lsass-dump malware that utilises duplicated handle with AES Encryption to avoid detections.

### 🔹 [.NET Shellcode Injector HTTP](https://github.com/JimKw1kX/Shellcode-Injector)  🔹 [.NET Shellcode Injector HTTPS](https://github.com/JimKw1kX/Shellcode-Injector-https)
- A shellcode injector tool to inject shellcode into VBA macros to bypass bypass Attack surface reduction (ASR).

### 🔹 [AWS-Web-Scanner](https://github.com/JimKw1kX/Shellcode-Injector-https)
- A web scan tool using AWS lambda function and Fargate.






## 🤖 AI/ML Projects

### 🔹 [ML Data Analysis](https://github.com/JimKw1kX/AI-ML-Notes/blob/main/ML/Data-Visualisation-ML.ipynb)
-  Utilised machine learning libraries Panda, Numpy and Matplotlib to analyse security datasets, identified abnormal patterns and data
exfiltration attacks using the K-means clustering algorithm, and performed data visualisation using Matplotlib

### 🔹 [Train GPT2 (124M) From Scratch](https://github.com/JimKw1kX/AI-ML-Notes/blob/main/LLM/GPT-2/train_gpt2.py)
-  A GPT2 script built from Scratch , can be trained on [A100 Nvidia GPU](https://lambdalabs.com/) about few hours.
